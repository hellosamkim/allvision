                    <h2>Our History</h2>

                    <p>Allvision has been in the OOH space for over 15 years. The company has concentrated on the development side of the business for the vast majority of that time having developed a significant portion of the most highly valued large format DOOH inventory across Canada and the United States.</p>

                    <p>In 2014, Allvision formed a sister company in Canada, Dynamic Outdoor, which marketed and sold the owned assets until having been acquired by OUTFRONT Media in June of 2017. Allvision continued to develop assets post acquisition and now have fourty seven (47) large format digital faces between Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. The company maintains a dominant position in the GTA with large format assets on the 400 series highways (401, 407, 403, 427, etc) with more to come, and owns the Mississauga underpass bridge network which is a unique, can’t miss, Digital format which will be further developed across the country. Allvision also owns and operates Premium large format assets in Montreal and Vancouver. Allvision took the necessary steps in May of 2020, to transition into a full-service operator in Canada and officially launches June 29.</p>

                    <p>Allvision will bring first-to-market technologies that will lead the industry in transactional efficiency and audience based solutions.</p>
