                    <h6>Our Commitment:</h6>

                    <p>We want our assets, services and production to be a part of a sustainable society. We are committed to:</p>

                    <h6>a) Sustainable Energy</h6>

                    <p>We are committed to the use of clean, green energy for our digital signage and throughout our business. Through our partnership with Bullfrog Power, Canada’s leading green energy provider, we are committed to eliminating our energy-related emissions footprint, bringing new, community-based renewable energy projects online, and helping green Canada’s energy systems.</p>

                    <h6>b) Responsible Construction Practices</h6>

                    <p>Allvision has always strived to support local suppliers for all of our material needs in the construction of our signage and assets. We are committed to doing our part to minimize our carbon footprint and environmental impact by working with our partners towards the goal that at least 75% of materials used in our construction projects are produced and procured in Canada.</p>

                    <p>We are also dedicated to exploring any new advancements in environmentally-friendly building practices, materials, and recycling that we believe could be integrated into our business.</p>

                    <h6>c) Regulatory Compliance</h6>

                    <p>We will work closely with regulatory agencies and industry associations to affect the development of sound environmental protection policies, procedures and legislation. We will as a minimum, assure compliance with our legal requirements and other requirements to which Allvision subscribes.</p>

                    <h6>d) Employee Engagement</h6>

                    <p>Allvision will raise employee awareness and support employee creativity and enthusiasm with respect to implementing our policies, guidelines, programs and initiatives and will continually promote environmental awareness, responsibility and best practices to support the environmental sustainability culture of our company through education and in-house initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint.</p>

                    <p>Signed,</p>
